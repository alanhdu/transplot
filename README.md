transplot
====

A plotting library designed to work nicely w/ a GUI interface. Excel-style
select from list-of-plots is quite atrocious (aside from being incomplete).
You should be thinking of what you want to show, not about which drop-down 
option would work best.

Probably will event up w/ ggplot-like interface. Bokeh will be used for
rendering.
